To edit a Wiki page, you will first need to log into your GitHub account. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for one at https://github.com.

== Four Steps to Editing a Wiki Page == 
# Click on the "Edit" button in the upper right hand corner above the text box and select "MediaWiki" from the pull-down menu of the "Edit mode:" above the text box.
# Make changes in the text box and leave a short message in the "Edit Message" field at the bottom of the page to explain the changes. 
# Click on the "Preview" tab in the upper left hand corner above the text box to see how your newly-edited page will look before committing the changes. 
# Click on the "Save Page" button in the lower right hand corner of the page.
Once you learn how, editing a Wiki page takes seconds! We encourage you to get your feet wet with the following easy edits:
* If you see a typo, fix it!
* If an instruction can be more clear, clarify it!
* If information is outdated, you can update it if you have time, but if not, at least leave a note (like "-NEEDS UPDATING-") for your fellow Wiki users!

To familiarize yourself with the MediaWiki markup language, you can do so by looking at the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting MediaWiki Formatting Help Page]. Another way is to learn by example: when you see formatted text on a page, click on the Edit button to see how it's done.
