This tutorial is intended to get you started quickly in running a WESTPA simulation.

== Installing WESTPA ==

To install WESTPA, just follow the four steps below.

1. Install the Python 2.7 version provided by the latest free [[Anaconda Python distribution|https://www.continuum.io/downloads]]. 

2. Either add the Python executable to your $PATH or set the environment variable WEST_PYTHON: 
<pre>export WEST_PYTHON=/opt/anaconda/bin/python2.7</pre>

3. Install the latest WESTPA release by downloading the [[tar.gz file|https://github.com/westpa/westpa/releases]] and executing the following: 
<pre>tar xvzf westpa-master.tar.gz
cd westpa
./setup.sh </pre>

4. Run the resulting westpa.sh script to set the following environment variables: 
<pre>WEST_ROOT
WEST_BIN
WEST_PYTHON</pre>

== Running a WESTPA simulation ==

Now let's run a quick WESTPA simulation of Na+/Cl- association using the NAMD dynamics engine. To run this simulation, follow the four steps below. 

1. Check that you have the binary for the NAMD dynamics engine in your PATH variable
<pre>#which namd2</pre>

2. Export the WEST_ROOT environment variable
<pre>#export WEST_ROOT=$(pwd)</pre>

3. Head over to the example simulation directory and initialize the simulation

<pre>#cd lib/examples/nacl_namd
#./init.sh
simulation nacl_namd root is $HOME/westpa/lib/examples/nacl_namd
Creating HDF5 file '$HOME/westpa/lib/examples/nacl_namd/west.h5'
2 target state(s) present
Calculating progress coordinate values for basis states.
1 basis state(s) present
Preparing initial states

        Total bins:            22
        Initial replicas:      24 in 1 bins, total weight = 1
        Total target replicas: 528

Simulation prepared.
1 of 22 (4.545455%) active bins are populated
per-bin minimum non-zero probability:       1
per-bin maximum probability:                1
per-bin probability dynamic range (kT):     0
per-segment minimum non-zero probability:   0.0416667
per-segment maximum non-zero probability:   0.0416667
per-segment probability dynamic range (kT): 0
norm = 1, error in norm = 0 (0*epsilon)</pre>

4. Run the WESTPA simulation

<pre>#./run.sh
simulation nacl_namd root is $HOME/westpa/lib/examples/nacl_namd</pre>
Voila! Your simulation results can be found in the west.h5 file. 

We recommend that you complete at least one of the [[WESTPA Tutorials|Introductory Tutorials]] before moving on to run WESTPA simulations of your own system.
