= Documentation Practices =

Documentation for WESTPA is maintained using [http://sphinx-doc.org/ Sphinx] Docstrings are formatted in the [https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt Numpy style], which are converted to ReStructuredText using Sphinx' [http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.org/en/latest/ Napoleon] plugin, which is included with Sphinx 1.3.

The documentation may be built by navigating to the <code>doc</code> folder, and running:

<pre>make html</pre>
to prepare an html version or:

<pre>make latexpdf</pre>
To prepare a pdf. The latter requires <code>latex</code> to be available.

A quick command to update the documentation in gh-pages repo is also available:

<pre>make ghpages</pre>
This command will run Sphinx html command and change the htmls to fit with the gh-pages format, it also runs:

<pre>git checkout gh-pages
git commit -a
git push</pre>
for you. Also note that this will change the current branch you are at to gh-pages branch. It also leaves behind a doc/_build folder that is no longer useful. Once you run ghpages command I suggest going up a folder and removing the unnecessary doc folder that is there by:

<pre>cd ../
rm -r doc</pre>
Remeber to make sure you are indeed in gh-pages branch, this branch is not supposed to have a folder named doc. Sometimes if you are not careful git checkout fails and you might end up removing the folder you were working with if you are not careful.
