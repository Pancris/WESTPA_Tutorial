To edit a Wiki page, you will first need to log into your GitHub account. If you do not have an account, you can sign up for one at https://github.com.

== Four Steps to Editing a Wiki Page == 
# Click on the white "Edit" button at the top of the page and select "MediaWiki" from the pull-down menu for the "Edit mode:"
# Make changes in the text box and leave a short message in the "Edit Message" field at the bottom of the page. 
# Click on the "Preview" tab above the text box to see how your newly-edited page will look before committing the changes. 
# Click on the green "Save Page" button at the bottom of the page.
Once you learn how, editing a Wiki page takes seconds! We encourage you to get your feet wet with the following easy edits:
* If you see a typo, fix it!
* If an instruction can be more clear, clarify it!
* If information is outdated, you can update it if you have time, but if not, at least leave a note (like "-NEEDS UPDATING-") for your fellow Wiki users!

To familiarize yourself with the MediaWiki markup language, you can do so by looking at the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting MediaWiki Formatting Help Page]. Another way is to learn by example: when you see formatted text on a page, click on the Edit button to see how it's done.
