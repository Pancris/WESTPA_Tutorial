= NAMD Tutorial: Molecular Dynamics of Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> Association =

by Karl Debiec and Ali Saglam

Updated with WESTPA version 1.0 beta and NAMD 2.1.0

== Overview ==

Requirements: ~3 hr wallclock time on an 8-core Intel Westmere node (one walker per core); ~1.3 GB disk space

In this tutorial we will use the standard weighted ensemble approach to simulate Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> association in Generalized Born implicit solvent. The system consists of single Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions modeled with the [http://mackerell.umaryland.edu/charmm_ff.shtml CHARMM force field], using the distance between the two ions as the progress coordinate. [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/namd NAMD] will be used to run the molecular dynamics, and familiarity with it is a prerequisite (see [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Training/Tutorials/namd-index.html tutorials]). Basic knowledge of python and bash scripting is also necessary.

The first step is to set up a directory containing the necessary NAMD and WESTPA files. A working example directory can be found at <code>westpa/lib/examples/nacl_namd</code>.

== Preparing the NAMD files ==

The above files are included in the <code>namd_config</code> subfolder of the example directory, and should be familiar to NAMD users. Note that two configuration files are present. <code>md-genvel.conf</code> is used for initial segments, in which it is necessary to generate initial velocities, and <code>md-continue.conf</code> is used for continuations, in which velocities are inherited from the parent segment.

Several settings in this configuration file are important to WESTPA. First is the the segment duration, τ, which is equal to the timestep times the number of steps. The appropriate τ depends on the system and progress coordinate, and for this system we have chosen 0.5 ps. Second is the use of the stochastic Langevin thermostat; WESTPA requires a stochastic element such that trajectories branched from a common point diverge. In order to ensure that this occurs, it is also necessary to set the random seed to a different value for each segment. Setting the random seed based on the time, as is common for brute-force simulations, may cause problems as simulations started simultaneously from the same parent will not diverge.

NAMD configuration files support tcl scripting, which we use to export each frame of the trajectory after dynamics have been run.

}</pre>
This allows us to read the coordinates for each frame in bash without relying on an external program such as [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd Visual Molecular Dynamics]. This is done for this tutorial to avoid dependence on other software; in production simulations it is preferable to use faster methods.

The analogous <code>md-genvel.conf</code> differs only in that it does not load velocities from the input file, instead generating them from a Maxwellian distribution.

== Preparing the WESTPA files ==

|}

The above files are listed roughly in the order in which it is appropriate to configure them. <code>gen_istate.sh</code>, <code>get_pcoord.sh</code>, <code>runseg.sh</code>, and <code>post_iter.sh</code> are located in the <code>westpa_scripts</code> subfolder.

=== env.sh ===

This script sets environment variables that may be used across the simulation. These include the root directory for WESTPA, the root directory for the simulation, the name for the simulation, and the python executable to use. It also sets the executable for NAMD; using an environment variable for this purpose makes it easier to transition code to different hardware or test different builds or flags of an MD code without editing multiple files.

=== gen_istates.sh ===

This script generates initial states (structures) for the simulation from the basis states (structures) stored in the <code>bstates</code> subfolder. Our system contains a single basis state containing the two ions with a separation of 9.90 Å; this script generates slight variations of this distance in order to obtain a greater variety of starting configurations.

=== get_pcoord.sh ===

This script calculates the progress coordinate from the initial states. Our progress coordinate is the distance between the Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> ions; since it is very simple, we may calculate it using only shell commands. Note that this script is used only during initial state generation; during production <code>runseg.sh</code> calculates the progress coordinate.

=== system.py ===

This file contains the python implementation of this WESTPA system. Here are specified the number of dimensions in the progress coordinate, the number of frames to be output per segment, the bin boundaries, and the number of walkers per bin. For this system we use 22 bins as defined by [http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/ct100626x Zwier, Kaus, and Chong], and 24 walkers per bin. <code>system.py</code> also includes the functions <code>coord_loader</code> and <code>log_loader</code>. In addition to the progress coordinate, WESTPA includes the ability to calculate and store auxiliary data as the simulation is run. This is often easier than looping over iterations and segments afterwards. Since our system contains only two atoms, it is reasonable for us to store all coordinate information in the same hdf5 file as the progress coordinate. We will also store the log information including time, energy, and temperature.

=== runseg.sh ===

This script runs individual segments, calculates and outputs their progress coordinates, and outputs auxiliary data. For each iteration and segment it generates a folder, linking to the files necessary for running NAMD. For the NAMD configuration file, it uses <code>sed</code> to input a random seed generated by WESTPA. It then runs NAMD, calculates and outputs the progress coordinate and auxiliary data, and removes files that are no longer needed. As in <code>get_pcoord.sh</code>, the progress coordinate is calculated using shell commands. The auxiliary coordinate dataset is prepared using the coor files output by NAMD, which are processed using shell commands and output to a temporary file, from which it is read by the <code>coord_loader</code> function in <code>system.py</code>. The auxiliary log data is similarly processed using shell commands and output to a temporary file, from which it is read by the <code>log_loader</code> function in <code>system.py</code>.

=== post_iter.sh ===

This script cleans up after each iteration. WESTPA simulations can generate large numbers of files, potentially conflicting with filesystem restrictions. After each iteration, <code>post_iter.sh</code> moves the segment logs the associated segment logs to a tar file.

=== west.cfg ===

This file contains the WESTPA configuration, including the locations of various scripts and the nature of the anticipated output. Additionally, this is where the number of iterations and maximum production time are set. Some optional functions, such as the ability to run a designated script before each iteration, are listed but unused in this tutorial.

=== init.sh ===

This script initializes the WESTPA system. It removes files from previous runs and uses <code>gen_istates.sh</code> and <code>get_pcoord.sh</code> to generate initial states. This is also where the basis states and target states are defined. For this system we define the bound target state as 1.8 Å separation, and the unbound target state as 16.9 Å separation. Once walkers reach the bins containing these values (i.e. our first and final bins), they are recycled. <code>init.sh</code> is also one of two places where we specify the number of walkers per bin, as <code>--segs-per-state</code>.

=== run.sh ===

This script is used to run WESTPA.

=== tar_segs.sh ===

This script is used to tar segments after the WESTPA simulation has been run, in order to reduce the number of files produced. In order to allow extension of the simulation, the last segment is not tarred. Typically, it is advisable not to tar segments after each iteration (i.e. in <code>post_iter.sh</code>), while the main WESTPA process is tarring, other cores are idle, potentially wasting CPU time.

== Running the simulation ==

From the simulation root directory (<code>$WEST_SIM_ROOT</code>), the simulation may be initialized using the command:

<pre>./init.sh</pre>
and run using the command:

<pre>./run.sh</pre>
<code>init.sh</code> and <code>run.sh</code> call <code>w_init</code> and <code>w_run</code> from WESTPA. By default WESTPA will use as many cores as are available on the host machine. If the simulation is run on a computing cluster, <code>w_run</code> may be executed from a batch script. See the running page for more information on how to submit jobs to specific clusters.

==== traj_segs ====

This folder stores the results of the WESTPA simulation, organized by iteration and segment. This includes all files generated by <code>runseg.sh</code>, including those generated by NAMD. For this system, the only files saved are <code>seg.coor</code>, <code>seg.vel</code>, and <code>seg.log</code> corresponding to the coordinates, velocities, and log. After the simulation has been run, <code>tar_segs.sh</code> may be used to reduce each iteration to a single tar file.

==== seg_logs ====

This folder stores logs from each iteration and segment. <code>post_iter.sh</code> has been used to combine each segment into a single tar file.

==== west.h5 ====

This file stores the simulation output in an hdf5 database. This includes the relationships between successive walkers, bin weights, progress coordinates, and auxiliary data.

==== west.log ====

This file contains a brief log of simulation progress. As WESTPA runs, it outputs information such as the current iteration number, the number of populated bins, and the time needed for each iteration in this log. This is also where errors are output.

Since only 10 iterations have been run, we do not yet have enough data to analyze. Edit <code>west.cfg</code> and change <code>max_total_iterations</code> to 100. Extend using the command:

<pre>./run.sh</pre>
=== Computing the association rate ===

WESTPA includes several tools for analysis located in <code>$WEST_ROOT/bin</code>. In <code>init.sh</code> we specified the bin containing an Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl<sup>-</sup> distance of 1.8 Å as the bound state, and that containing a distance of 16.9 Å as the unbound state. Using <code>w_fluxanl</code>, we can calculate the flux into these target states, and from that calculate the association rate of Na<sup>+</sup>/Cl
<sup>-</sup>. <code>w_fluxanl</code> may be run with the following commands:

<pre>source env.sh
$WEST_ROOT/bin/w_fluxanl</pre>
The script will output the flux into the target states including confidence intervals calculated using the block bootstrap method:

<pre>Calculating mean flux and confidence intervals for iterations [1,101)
target 'unbound':
  correlation length = a tau
  mean flux and CI   = b (c, d) tau^(-1)
target 'bound':
  correlation length = w tau
  mean flux and CI   = x (y, z) tau^(-1)</pre>
More information on how to use <code>w_fluxanl</code> can be viewed using the <code>--help</code> flag. <code>w_fluxanl</code> also stores this information in an hdf5 file, <code>fluxanl.h5</code>. Using the python libraries h5py and pylab, we can visualize this data. Open a python interpreter and run the following commands:

<pre>import h5py, numpy, pylab
fluxanl              = h5py.File('fluxanl.h5')
flux                 = numpy.zeros(100)
first_binding        = 100 - fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux'].shape[0]
flux[first_binding:] = numpy.array(fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux'])
pylab.plot(flux)
pylab.xlabel("Iteration")
pylab.ylabel("Instantaneous Flux $(\frac{1}{\tau})$")
pylab.show()</pre>
[[File:../_static/nacl_namd_flux_instantaneous.png|frame|none]]

The x-axis represents the iteration number, and the y-axis the flux into the bound state in units of τ<sup>-1</sup> during that iteration. In the above simulation, the first transition to the unbound state occurred in iteration 2, and the first transition to the bound state occurred in iteration 3. The instantaneous flux is noisy and difficult to interpret, and it is clearer to view the time evolution of the flux. Run <code>w_fluxanl</code> again, this time with the <code>--evol</code> flag:

<pre>$WEST_ROOT/bin/w_fluxanl --evol</pre>
We may plot the time evolution of flux using the following commands at a python interpreter:

<pre>import h5py, numpy, pylab
fluxanl   = h5py.File('fluxanl.h5')
mean_flux = numpy.zeros(100)
ci_ub     = numpy.zeros(100)
ci_lb     = numpy.zeros(100)
first_binding             = 100 - fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux_evolution']['expected'].shape[0]
mean_flux[first_binding:] = numpy.array(fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux_evolution']['expected'])
ci_lb[first_binding:]     = numpy.array(fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux_evolution']['ci_lbound'])
ci_ub[first_binding:]     = numpy.array(fluxanl['target_flux']['target_1']['flux_evolution']['ci_ubound'])
pylab.plot(mean_flux, 'b', ci_lb, 'g', ci_ub, 'r')
pylab.xlabel("Iteration")
pylab.ylabel("Mean Flux $(\frac{1}{\tau})$")
pylab.show()</pre>
[[File:../_static/nacl_namd_flux_evolution.png|frame|none]]

We can see that the flux has plateaued, indicating that the simulation has reached steady-state conditions. When calculating the rate, we discard the portion of data during which the system is equilibrating, using only portion over which the rates are steady and converging. We may calculate the rate using only the last 50 iterations:

<pre>$WEST_ROOT/bin/w_fluxanl --first-iter 50

Calculating mean flux and confidence intervals for iterations [50,101)
target 'unbound':
  correlation length = 1 tau
  mean flux and CI   = 1.268496e-01 (1.179945e-01,1.355673e-01) tau^(-1)
target 'bound':
  correlation length = 0 tau
  mean flux and CI   = 7.917146e-03 (5.870760e-03,1.014573e-02) tau^(-1)</pre>
Your output should be within an order of magnitude. Since τ for our simulation was 0.5 ps, in order to determine the association rate in units of ps
<sup>-1</sup>, the flux should be multiplied by 2, giving an association rate of 1.6 x 10<sup>-2</sup> ps<sup>-1</sup> with a 95% CI of 1.2 x10<sup>-2</sup> to 2.0 x10<sup>-2</sup>. In order to obtain a more precise association rate, we would need to run more iterations of the simulation, which may be done by editing <code>west.cfg</code>.

=== Visualizing a selected pathway ===

Westpa includes the tools <code>w_succ</code> and <code>w_trace</code> to make concatenating the segments for one of your completed pathways straightforward. Both <code>w_succ</code> and <code>w_trace</code> are located in <code>$WEST_ROOT/bin</code>.

First use <code>w_succ</code> by entering into the command line from your simulation root directory:

<pre>source env.sh
$WEST_ROOT/bin/w_succ</pre>
<code>w_succ</code> will output a list of every completed pathway, listed by its iteration and segment ids. The target state each pathway has reached may be determined from the final value of the progress coordinate. Pick any set of completed iteration and segment ids and use them with the <code>w_trace</code> tool. For example, if iteration 17 segment 2 is a completed pathway, run:

<pre>$WEST_ROOT/bin/w_trace 17:2</pre>
<code>w_trace</code> will output a text file named <code>traj_17_2_trace.txt</code> listing the iteration and segment ids for the chain of continuing segments leading up to the successful completion of your simulation. This file includes the iteration, seg_id, weight, wallclock time, CPU time, and final progress coordinate value for each segment comprising the trajectory. The first line, listed as iteration 0, includes the initial state ID. The same information is stored in hdf5 format in the outfile <code>trajs.h5</code>.

By combining the information in this file with the coordinates stored in <code>west.h5</code>, we can generate a complete trajectory viewable using [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd Visual Molecular Dynamics] using the script <code>cat_trajectory.py</code>, included in the <code>westpa_scripts</code> subfolder:

<pre>import h5py, numpy, sys

infile = numpy.loadtxt(sys.argv[1], usecols = (0, 1))
west   = h5py.File('west.h5')
coords = []
for iteration, seg_id in infile[1:]:
    iter_key = "iter_{0:08d}".format(int(iteration))
    SOD      = west['iterations'][iter_key]['auxdata']['coord'][seg_id,1:,0,:]
    CLA      = west['iterations'][iter_key]['auxdata']['coord'][seg_id,1:,1,:]
    coords  += [numpy.column_stack((SOD, CLA))]
with open(sys.argv[1][:-4] + ".xyz", 'w') as outfile:
    for i, frame in enumerate(numpy.concatenate(coords)):
        outfile.write("2\n")
        outfile.write("{0}\n".format(i))
        outfile.write("SOD {0:9.5f} {1:9.5f} {2:9.5f}\n".format(
          float(frame[0]), float(frame[1]), float(frame[2])))
        outfile.write("CLA {0:9.5f} {1:9.5f} {2:9.5f}\n".format(
          float(frame[3]), float(frame[4]), float(frame[5])))</pre>
This script takes <code>w_trace</code> output as a command line argument, loads the iteration and segment IDs, loads the coordinates for each segment from west.h5, and saves the results into an xyz file viewable using [http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd VMD].

== Useful hints ==

* Make sure your paths are set correctly in env.sh`
* If the simulation doesn't stop properly with CTRL+C , use CTRL+Z. 
* Another method to stop the simulation relatively cleanly is to rename <code>runseg.sh</code>; WESTPA will shut the simulation down and prevent the hdf5 file from becoming corrupted. Some extra steps may be necessary to ensure that the analysis scripts can be run successfully.
